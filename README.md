## Final Assignment Data Science for Social Good

This repository was set up to host a Jupyter Notebook for a final assignment of a Data Science for Social Good course at the University of Salzburg. 

The aim was to investigate various potenial biases in machine learning, to understand who they affect and how they can have impacts, and what can be done to address them. 

The toolkit used in this analysis is 'Aequitas Bias and Fairness Audit Toolkit': http://www.datasciencepublicpolicy.org/projects/aequitas/
